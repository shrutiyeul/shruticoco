        If we had to define what AutoCAD is in a few words, we would say that it is a CAD-type software oriented to
         drawing and modeling in 2D and 3D. It allows the creation and modification of geometric models with an 
         almost infinite capacity to develop all types of structures and objects.

        This ability to work in different fields has made AutoCAD transcend its traditional use in the world of
         architecture and engineering, to enter the world of graphic and interior design.
        
        Currently, AutoCAD has a multitude of specialized auxiliary tools which cover everey kind of 
        industrial fields related to 2D design and 3D modeling</p>
